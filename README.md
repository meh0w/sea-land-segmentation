## Coastline detection based on optical images using neural networks
Repository contains implementations of different Neural Network models used for Sea-land segmentation task as well as necessary utilities to perform training and inference of said models. The code was implemented using the TensorFlow library but was later ported to PyTorch (old implementations are still available). The project also includes GUI application capable of configuring, training and testing models.
