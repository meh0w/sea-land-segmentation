## Coastline detection based on optical images using neural networks
Repository contains implementations of different Neural Network models used for Sea-land segmentation task as well as necessary utilities to perform training and inference of said models. The code was implemented using the TensorFlow library but is currently in a process of porting to PyTorch.
